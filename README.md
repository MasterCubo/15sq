This app has PWA support! Add it to your mobile homescreen by hitting Share, and then Add To Homescreen.

If you get a high score, take a screenshot of the alert message! Since a live leaderboard would require a live backend server which I have no intention of upholding, I instead will manually add submissions as no more than 3 ppl will ever use this app. Thats all!

# Story

To start off, me and my sister found this unbelievably dumb Snapchat filter that would take whatever picture you took into a 3x3 tile slider puzzle, and then had you solve it. 

Naturally, I had to be the best, so I was looking up if there was some trick to solving it.

The tile slider game (which I had never been able to solve the 4x4 before on pure logic before, mostly just guessing) had a SOLVED algorithm, like a rubix cube.

For any board size, the same algorithm works, and I was able to get insane times. I then got this iOS app, [Tile Slider](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tile-slider/id552709030) and it was pretty cool.

For one, it woud time my runs, so I could compete with my friend. But the 5x5 modes were locked, and the tapping animation slowed me down. So I vowed to make a better version myself.

I struggled for MONTHS to make one in python, my first coding language, the one I thought I knew best, and then promptly failed to make a a GUI version, and settled with a finnicky text based one.

You can still see it [here](https://replit.com/@Cuboo/15-SQ). It had a whole login system, so it wasn't awful, but it wasn't the best slider game.

Then I found this weird library called p5. and I was like lets try it. I made a couple funny sketches, little visualizations

Then my non-coder tile slider friend said why not make the game in this library.

I had NEVER coded in js before. 



First try.

What the flip dude.

So yeah now I feel strongest in JS and this is why.

Anywho, fast forward 5 months or something and its summer, and I'm bored out of my mind, so I go back to finishing old projects, porting all my github pages to my actual website, and I come across my 15sq game which still looked like ass, and wasn't even a website, just a p5 sketch. So I fixed the remaining bugs and here we are. yippee!

## Plans

none lmao
